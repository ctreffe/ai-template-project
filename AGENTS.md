# AGENTS.md

Resident contract.

## Safety

- Inspect repository, branch, worktree and staging; preserve changes,
  selections and unrelated work.
- Maintainers own intent, scope and consequential decisions.
- Authorized reads and edits are allowed. Commits, tags, pushes, pulls, merges,
  rebases, resets, reverts, branches, stashes, destructive restores and direct
  `.git/` changes each require an instruction containing `explicit`,
  `explicitly` or German `explizit`.
- When such a control-word instruction is needed, propose one minimal copy-ready
  wording that names the exact action, repository and material consequence;
  the proposal is not authorization.
- Once exact staging is requested or its commit is authorized, run Git commands
  that write `.git` through narrow sandbox escalation on their first attempt;
  do not probe the expected `workspace-write` `.git/index.lock` denial. Keep
  read-only Git inspection sandboxed. Escalation grants no additional Git or
  standing authority.
- Use normal sandboxed execution when it is equally effective. If an already
  authorized in-scope action requires crossing a platform boundary, promptly
  request the narrowest sufficient escalation through the platform mechanism;
  do not omit or replace the action merely to avoid approval. Ask separately in
  prose only when action authority is missing or unclear. Escalation grants no
  broader repository, action, path, input, external-write, Git, publication or
  standing authority.
- Ask before installation, privilege, external operations, outside writes or
  transmission; access, versioning and publication are separate.
- Retry once only if plausibly transient. On recurrence or setup/policy error,
  pause; use `troubleshoot-environment`; describe the problem and ask whether
  to exit for an ordinary quick workaround or resolve the cause. Explicit
  maintainer invocation enters focused resolution directly. Verify a repair
  only by continuing the originally blocked operation.
- `input/intake/` grants no access; keep `input/` unchanged. Registered
  `materials/` and unrestricted `temp/` are readable; never version temporary
  content or inspect `temp/restricted/`. Synchronization grants no access.

## Routing

- Bounded work uses `start-task`, `TASK_HANDOFF.md`, targets and checks. Load
  `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` only for project-wide state or
  unresolved scope.
- Read `COLLABORATION.md` for initialization, full review, authority
  conflicts or collaboration-model changes. Load `REPOSITORY.md`,
  `DOCUMENTATION.md`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md` and domain
  guidance only when applicable.
- Read `DECISIONS.md` and applicable records before durable changes.
- Task entry, handoff, ordinary commits and Decision Records route
  automatically. Invoke initialization, review, template sync,
  consistency checks, retrospectives, local creation and `commit-milestone`
  explicitly.
- Keep the template generic. Resolve material guidance conflicts before
  consequential work.

## Validation

Codex skill edits use `scripts/Test-CodexSkill.ps1`; on first use follow
`VALIDATION.md` to prepare the pinned local dependency without global installs.

Scale evidence by stage: an acceptable bounded change needs the smallest useful
review, an ordinary commit needs targeted evidence for a good reviewable state,
and a milestone commit owns comprehensive applicable checks. Automated tests,
whitespace checks, broad renders, links and bilingual scans are not defaults
before the milestone unless affected or required by a stated material risk.
Report outcomes, limits and deferred checks truthfully.
