# Start Task

Establish only the context needed for the requested objective.

1. Read the closest repository instructions and current `TASK_HANDOFF.md` when
   present. Reconcile any transient Git observation there with live repository
   state. A commit created after a completed handoff is normal lifecycle
   progression, not a stale handoff; do not surface that mismatch unless it
   changes the recorded outcome, substantive open points or continuation.
   Treat an otherwise stale or unrelated handoff as non-authoritative.
2. Inspect branch, working tree and staged state without changing them.
3. State the outcome, repository scope and important non-goals.
4. Read the target and only directly applicable authority, domain, decision and
   validation material. Prefer matched sections, changed hunks and bounded
   output before full files or diffs.
5. Perform the bounded work. Obtain only the smallest evidence needed to show
   that the affected behavior or text is acceptable and aligned with project
   intent; an automated check is optional. Do not default to whitespace checks,
   broad renders or complete suites. Exercise a changed validator narrowly and
   escalate only for a stated material risk.
6. Report evidence actually obtained and checks deferred or not run. Keep
   successful output concise and retain focused diagnostics for failures.

Escalate to the repository's review skill only when identity, authority or
current state cannot be established safely through this route.
