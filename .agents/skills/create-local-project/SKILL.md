# Create Local Project

Confirm the source template, target path, target emptiness and intended local-only
Git state. Create the project with history preserved through a local clone that
does not share object storage, remove the inherited remote and verify that no
remote remains.

Read the new repository's own instructions before invoking `start-project`.
Carry the exact verified source-template clone path into that initialization
only to seed the new repository's ignored `RETROSPECTIVE_PATHS.local.md`; the
path grants no source access or cross-repository action authority.
That initialization replaces inherited source-template maintenance history in
`CHANGELOG.md` and `TASK_HANDOFF.md` with project-owned state while retaining
lineage in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. After successful initialization, remove only
the project copy of this template-only creation skill and other explicitly
identified template-only artifacts. Preserve initialization and setup documents
as provenance. Repository creation, cleanup, commits and remote configuration
remain separately governed operations.
