# Commit Changes

Confirm repository scope, working-tree state, staged selection and changed
hunks. Preserve unrelated and pre-existing changes. Reuse current evidence
while governed inputs have not changed.

An ordinary commit needs a good, targeted and reviewable state, not a complete
repository gate. Select the smallest check or review that materially increases
confidence in the changed behavior, text or contract. Automated tests,
whitespace checks, broad renders, builds and full suites are optional unless
affected or required by a stated material risk. A failed relevant check must be
diagnosed and rerun after an in-scope fix. Keep success output concise and
retain focused failure diagnostics. Member repositories do not run the family
validator; possible shared consequences become a Governance follow-up.

Then present and check the complete proposed message. An ordinary summary uses
one exact direct prefix from `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`,
`test:`, `ci:` or `build:` followed by a concise imperative summary. Scoped
forms such as `feat(scope):` do not satisfy this repository-family convention.
Provide a meaningful body that explains purpose, material changes, important
boundaries and relevant validation without merely repeating the summary. Use
real line breaks and reject literal `\n` escape text. Milestone metadata is
handled only by `commit-milestone`.

When `TASK_HANDOFF.md` is included, confirm that its completed-state wording
remains true after the commit. Do not update it after committing merely to
record that the commit occurred; later work reconstructs live Git state.

Create the commit only after action-specific authorization required by the
repository. If its control word is still needed, propose one minimal copy-ready
instruction naming the exact action, repository and material consequence; the
proposal is not authorization. Verify the resulting commit, including its
complete message, and the remaining working tree. A push is a separate
protected action: perform it only when separately authorized, using a separate
copy-ready suggestion when needed, then verify local HEAD and the intended
upstream revision.

Stop instead of silently widening scope, repairing unrelated failures or
including files that were not reviewed.
