# Commit Milestone

Use only when the maintainer explicitly invokes `$commit-milestone` for an
identified milestone or version closure. This is not a substitute for
developing or reviewing the milestone.

1. Establish the exact repository, completed version or milestone, Git state
   and staged file list.
2. Inspect staged versions of relevant version, changelog, README, objective or
   roadmap and handoff files. Read a full staged patch or unrelated working-tree
   file only when an inconsistency requires it.
3. Classify the semantic scope and run the repository's comprehensive
   applicable validation after milestone inputs are stable. Add release,
   rendering, visual, security, privacy, statistical or other domain checks
   required by the declared milestone. Reuse current evidence only where the
   milestone contract permits it and governed inputs are unchanged. Bound
   success output, retain failure diagnostics and rerun affected checks after a
   relevant correction.
4. Check tags, upstream state and release rules with bounded commands. Load
   additional authority only for a real conflict or gap.
5. Keep unstaged and untracked work outside the milestone and report it without
   inventorying unrelated contents.
6. Resolve only authorized closure gaps, rerun required validation and propose
   a human-readable versioned summary plus concise evidence-based body.
   The default `workspace-write` sandbox keeps `.git` read-only. Once exact
   milestone staging is requested or the milestone commit is authorized,
   request each `git add` and `git commit` command through the platform's
   narrow sandbox escalation on its first attempt; do not probe the expected
   `.git/index.lock` denial first. Keep read-only Git inspection sandboxed.
   Escalation changes only the execution boundary, grants no additional Git or
   path-selection authority and creates no persistent allow rule.
7. Create the commit only with action-specific authorization and verify it. If
   the repository control word is still needed, propose one minimal copy-ready
   instruction naming the exact action, repository and material consequence;
   the proposal is not authorization.

Push, tag creation, tag push and release publication remain separate protected
actions requiring their own authorization and post-action verification. When a
control word is still needed, propose separate copy-ready wording for each
independent action.
